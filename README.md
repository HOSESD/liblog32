# The Idea

THE WORLD'S MOST USELESS LIBRARY!

LibLog32 is a logging library, that's all you need to know

# Using it

To use it, you have to somehow figure out how to set the variables and then call another sub in the DLL file from a external program
i don['t care how the hell you do it, just figure it out

# Variables

There are 6 variables
X is a Int16
Y is a Int32
Z is a Int64

customvar1 is a String
customvar2 is a String
customvar3 is a String

When you call the second sub in this hot mess, all the variables get outputted out in the format "x, y, z, customvar1, customvar2, customvar3"
The variables have to set from your externel program otherwise it will default to "0, 0, 0, String, String, String"

Can you just use another library? YES
Can you integrate this to your program? YES
Do i care? NO
How would you do all this stuff? i HAVE NO CLUE
